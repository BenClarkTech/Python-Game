# Python-Game
This game is a group project for CIS 4930: Python Programming and COP 4360: Mobile Programming

The porting process is achieved by first adjusting the Python source code to be able to run on android. First all references to the keyword “None” had to be removed, as this is not applicable for the RAPT framework and breaks the game when it is ported to android. Next the pygame_sdl2 library needs to be imported as pygame at the top of the file (followed by an import of pygame). This allows the app to use sdl2 libraries when applicable and fills in the gaps with pygame logic (as stated earlier this allows graphics to be rendered on the Android platform). Next, a configuration file is created using RAPT for each individual app. This process even includes the creation of a key to be used for the play store. Various settings are specified including that the app should all be stored on local storage (as opposed to external), and that the app should lock the phone in landscape mode. Finally RAPT is used to create an APK which is automatically loaded onto a connected device and run. RAPT includes adb utilities to allow debugging of APKs
